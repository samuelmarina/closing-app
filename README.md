# ðŸ“« Closing App ðŸ“ª
An app that closes as soon as you open it... that's it.

## How it works
Just open it, it will close after 5 seconds. Maybe there's a suprise... maybe not.

## Give it a try!
If you have an Android device, you can download the APK [right here](https://cntr.click/5HtsNAm). 
If you have an iPhone, you just can't lol.
You can also clone this repo like this:

```
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/samuelmarina/closing-app.git
$ cd closing-app
```

And then just run it
```
# Install required packages
$ yarn install || npm install

# Run Expo
$ expo start

# Press a for Android emulator, or i for iOS simulator
# Or run it in your device using the other Expo options (e.g. QR code)
```

This project is made to be part of my series called "Useless Apps", not meant to be serious, but just useless. They're fun, but probably they don't work too well.
